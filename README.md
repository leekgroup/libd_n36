This repository is for hosting the code for the LIDB n36 project lead by AE Jaffe.

If you have any questions about the files in this directory contact AE Jaffe <andrew.jaffe@libd.org>.

Scripts use [derfinder](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/derfinder.html) and are organized in the following way:

* [derCoverageInfo](derCoverageInfo/): contains scripts for processing data from BAM files, filtering and creating Rdata files.
* [fullCoverage](fullCoverage/): similar as _derCoverageInfo_ but without filtering data.
* [derAnalysis](derAnalysis/): has scripts for creating the models, running the derfinder analysis one chromosome at a time, merging the results, and creating a html report.
